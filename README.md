# jamsomware

### CAUTION
This was developped for educational use. Since it lacks a lot of features a "good" ransomware would have, it really isn't worth using this for anything but educational use. It still has the power to harm a system and cause data loss, therefore handle with care and in a responsible way. I'm obviously not taking any responsibility for bugs or data loss or other harm.

### Features
* A simple, educational ransomware that was developped to evaluate ransomware detection tools.
* It's neither really good, nor is it supposed to be
* Uses symmetric encryption only with the key being stored in clear on the disk
* Has only been tested with Windows (packed using pyinstaller)
* Heavily uses recursive multiprocessing
